.. _Get Blob Service Stats:

Get Blob Service Stats
======================

The Get Blob Service Stats operation retrieves statistics related to
replication for the Blob service. It is only available on the secondary location
endpoint when read-access geo-redundant replication is enabled for the storage
account.

Request
-------

The Get Blob Service Stats request may be constructed as follows.  HTTPS is
recommended. The ``-secondary`` suffix is required when you replace
``myaccount`` with the name of your storage account. Replace example.com with
your endpoint's domain name or IP address.

Request Body
~~~~~~~~~~~~

None

Response
--------

The response includes an HTTP status code, a set of response headers, and a
response body.

Status Codes
~~~~~~~~~~~~

A successful operation returns status code 200 (OK). When called on secondary
location endpoint that is not enabled for secondary read, it returns an
HTTP status code of 403 with ``InsufficientAccountPermissions`` error.

Response Headers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The response for this operation includes the following headers. The response
also includes additional standard HTTP headers. All standard headers conform to
the HTTP/1.1 protocol specification.

   +============================+===========================================================+
   | ``x-ms-request-id``        | This header uniquely identifies the request that was made |
   |                            | and can be used for troubleshooting the request. For more |
   |                            | information, see |api-troubleshoot|.                      |
   +----------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
   | ``x-ms-version``           | Specifies the version of the operation used for the       |
   |                            | response. For more information, see |azure-versioning|.   |
   +----------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
   | ``Date``                   | A UTC date/time value generated by the service that       |
   |                            | indicates the time at which the response was initiated.   |
   +----------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
   | ``x-ms-client-request-id`` | This header can be used to troubleshoot requests and      |
   |                            | corresponding responses. The value of this header is      |
   |                            | equal to the value of the ``x-ms-client-request-id``      |
   |                            | header if it is present in the request and the value is   |
   |                            | at most 1024 visible ASCII characters. If the             |

   |                                   |   when replication is first       |
   |                                   |   enabled.                        |

   |                                   | read operations at the secondary. |
   |                                   | Primary writes after this point   |

Authorization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Only the account owner may call this operation.

Remarks
-------

   With geo-redundant replication, Azure Storage maintains your data durable in
   two locations. In both locations, Azure Storage constantly maintains multiple
   healthy replicas of your data.

   The location where you read, create, update, or delete data is the *primary*
   storage account location. The primary location exists in the region you
   choose at the time you create an account via the Azure Management Azure
   classic portal, for example, "North Central US". The location to which
   your data is replicated is the *secondary* location. The secondary location
   resides in a region that is automatically geographically paired with the
   primary region.  Read-only access is available from the secondary location,
   if read-access geo-redundant replication is enabled for your storage
   account. For more on read-access geo-redundant replication, see
   |geo-redundant|.

   To construct a request for a read operation against the secondary endpoint,
   append ``-secondary`` as a suffix to the account name in the URI that you use
   to read from Blob storage. For example, a secondary URI for the Get Blob
   operation will be similar to
   ``https://myaccount-secondary.blob.example.com/mycontainer/myblob``.
