.. _Put Blob:

Put Blob
========

The Put Blob operation creates a new block blob or updates the content of an
existing block blob.

Updating an existing block blob overwrites any existing metadata on the
blob. Partial updates are not supported with Put Blob; the content of the
existing blob is overwritten with the content of the new blob. To perform a
partial update of the content of a block blob, use the Put Block List operation.

Request
-------

Construct the Put Blob request as follows. HTTPS is recommended. Replace
``myaccount`` with the name of your storage account, and ``example.com`` with
your endpoint's domain name or IP address.

   |                                   | of the blob. The default type is  |

   |                                   | to the client when the Get Blob   |
   |                                   | operation is performed on the     |

   |                                   | during transport. When this       |
   |                                   | header is specified, the storage  |
   |                                   | service checks the hash that has  |

   |                                   | blob content. This hash is used   |
   |                                   | to verify the integrity of the    |
   |                                   | blob during transport. When this  |
   |                                   | header is specified, the storage  |
   |                                   | service checks the hash that has  |

   |                                   | with error code 400 (Bad          |

   |                                   | x-ms-content-crc64 headers are    |

   |                                   | with a 400 (Bad Request).         |

~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This operation can be called by the account owner and by any client with a
shared access signature that has permission to write to this blob or its
container.

Remarks
-------

When you create a blob, you must specify the block blob type using the
``x-ms-blob-type`` header. Blobserver only supports the block blob type.

The maximum size for a block blob created via Put Blob is 256 MB. If your
blob is larger than 256 MB, you must upload it as a set of blocks. For more
information, see :ref:`Put Block` and :ref:`Put Block List`. Calling ``Put
Blob`` is unnecessary if you upload the blob as a set of blocks.

If you attempt to upload a block blob that is larger than 256 MB, the service
returns status code 413 (Request Entity Too Large). The Blob service also
returns additional information about the error in the response, including the
maximum blob size permitted in bytes.

A blob has custom properties (set via headers) that you can use to store values
associated with standard HTTP headers. These values can subsequently be read by
calling :ref:`Get Blob Properties`, or modified by calling :ref:`Set Blob
Properties`. The custom property headers and corresponding standard HTTP header
are listed in the following table:

.. tabularcolumns:: ll
.. table::

   +----------------------+--------------------------------+
   | HTTP Header          | Custom Blob Property Header    |
   +======================+================================+
   | ``Content-Type``     | ``x-ms-blob-content-type``     |
   +----------------------+--------------------------------+
   | ``Content-Encoding`` | ``x-ms-blob-content-encoding`` |
   +----------------------+--------------------------------+
   | ``Content-Language`` | ``x-ms-blob-content-language`` |
   +----------------------+--------------------------------+
   | ``Content-MD5``      | ``x-ms-blob-content-md5``      |
   +----------------------+--------------------------------+
   | ``Cache-Control``    | ``x-ms-blob-cache-control``    |
   +----------------------+--------------------------------+

The semantics for setting persisting these property values with the blob as
follows:

-  If the client specifies a custom property header, as indicated by the
   ``x-ms-blob`` prefix, this value is stored with the blob.

-  If the client specifies a standard HTTP header, but not the custom property
   header, the value is stored in the corresponding custom property associated
   with the blob, and is returned by a call to Get Blob Properties. For
   example, if the client sets the ``Content-Type`` header on the request, that
   value is stored in the blob's ``x-ms-blob-content-type`` property.

-  If the client sets both the standard HTTP header and the corresponding
   property header on the same request, the PUT request uses the value provided
   for the standard HTTP header, but the value specified for the custom property
   header is persisted with the blob and returned by subsequent GET requests.

A Put Blob operation is permitted 10 minutes per MB to complete. If the
operation takes longer than 10 minutes per MB on average, the operation
times out.
