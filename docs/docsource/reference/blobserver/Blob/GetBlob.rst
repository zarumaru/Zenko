This operation also supports the use of conditional headers to read the blob
only if a specified condition is met. For more information, see |conditional-headers|.

Request Headers (Customer-provided encryption keys)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following headers may be specified on the request to read a blob encrypted
with a customer-provided key. Encryption with a customer-provided key (and the
corresponding set of headers) is optional. If a blob has previously been
encrypted with a customer-provided key, then these headers must be included on
the request to complete the read operation successfully.

Request Body
~~~~~~~~~~~~

None

Response
--------

The response includes an HTTP status code, a set of response headers, and the
response body, which contains the contents of the blob.

Status Code
~~~~~~~~~~~

A successful operation to read the full blob returns status code 200 (OK).

A successful operation to read a specified range returns status code 206
(Partial Content).

For information about status codes, see :ref:`Status and Error Codes`.

Response Headers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The response for this operation includes the following headers. The response may
also include additional standard HTTP headers. All standard headers conform to

Response Body
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The response body contains the content of the blob.


Sample Response
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   ::

      Status Response:
      HTTP/1.1 200 OK

      x-ms-copy-status: success
      x-ms-copy-progress: 11/11
      x-ms-copy-completion-time: <date>


Authorization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the container's access control list (ACL) is set to allow anonymous access to
the blob, any client may call this operation. If the container is private, this
operation can be performed by the account owner and by anyone with a Shared
Access Signature that has permission to read the blob.

Remarks
-------

A Get Blob operation is allowed 2 minutes per MB to complete. If the operation
is taking longer than 2 minutes per MB on average, the operation times out.

The ``x-ms-version`` header is required to retrieve a blob that belongs to a
private container. If the blob belongs to a container that is available for full
or partial public access, any client can read it without specifying a version;
the service version is not required for retrieving a blob that belongs to a
public container. See |manage-access| for more information.

Get Blob fails on archived block blobs.

Copy Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To determine if a Copy Blob operation has completed, first check that the
``x-ms-copy-id`` header value of the destination blob matches the copy ID
provided by the original call to Copy Blob.  A match assures that another
application did not abort the copy and start a new Copy Blob operation. Then
check for the ``x-ms-copy-status: success`` header.

.. note::

   All write operations on a blob except ``Put Block`` operations remove all
   ``x-ms-copy-*`` properties from the blob.

.. important::

   The URL returned in the ``x-ms-copy-source`` header contains any
   request parameters used in the copy operation on the source blob.
   If a SAS token is used to access the source blob, then that SAS
   token will appear in the the ``x-ms-copy-source`` header when
   Get Blob is called on the destination blob.

When ``x-ms-copy-status: failed`` appears in the response,
``x-ms-copy-status-description`` contains more information about the ``Copy
Blob`` failure.

The following table describes the three fields of every
``x-ms-copy-status-description`` value.
