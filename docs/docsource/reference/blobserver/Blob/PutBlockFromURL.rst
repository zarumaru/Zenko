   |                               | the operation fails with error code 400     |
   |                               | (Bad Request).                              |

Remarks
-------

Put Block From URL uploads a block for future inclusion in a block blob. A
block blob can include a maximum of 50,000 blocks. Each block can be a different
size, up to a maximum of 100 MB. The maximum size of a block blob is therefore
slightly more than 4.75 TB (100 MB X 50,000 blocks).

A blob can have a maximum of 100,000 uncommitted blocks at any given time. The
set of uncommitted blocks cannot exceed 9.52 TB in total size. If this maximum
is exceeded, the service returns status code 409
(RequestEntityTooLargeBlockCountExceedsLimit).

After you have uploaded a set of blocks, you can create or update the blob on
the server from this set by calling the Put Block List operation. Each block in
the set is identified by a block ID that is unique within that blob. Block IDs
are scoped to a particular blob, so different blobs can have blocks with same
IDs.

If you call Put Block From URL on a blob that does not yet exist, a new block
blob is created with a content length of 0. This blob is enumerated by the List
Blobs operation if the ``include=uncommittedblobs`` option is specified. The
block or blocks that you uploaded are not committed until you call Put Block
List on the new blob. A blob created this way is maintained on the server for a
week; if no more blocks are added or committed to the blob within that time, the
blob is garbage-collected.

A block that has been successfully uploaded with Put Block From URL does not
become part of a blob until it is committed with Put Block List. Before Put
Block List is called to commit the new or updated blob, any calls to Get Blob
return the blob contents without the uncommitted block.

If you upload a block that has the same block ID as another block that has not
yet been committed, the last uploaded block with that ID is committed on
the next successful Put Block List operation.

After Put Block List is called, all uncommitted blocks specified in the block
list are committed as part of the new blob. Any uncommitted blocks not specified
in the block list for the blob are garbage-collected and removed from the Blob
service. Any uncommitted blocks are also garbage-collected if there are no
successful calls to Put Block From URL or Put Block List on the same blob within
a week following the last successful Put Block From URL operation. If Put Blob
is called on the blob, any uncommitted blocks are garbage-collected.

For a given blob, all block IDs must be the same length. If a block is uploaded
with a block ID of a different length than the block IDs for any existing
uncommitted blocks, the service returns error response code 400 (Bad Request).

Calling Put Block From URL does not update the last modified time of an existing
blob.
